# jv-get-numbers-from-string

Implement method `getAllNumbers(String text` which accepts a String containing letters, digits and other symbols.

You need to put all digits that this String contains, to a separate array, 
then multiply each element of that array by 2, and return the result array.

Example: for a String `"data 48 call 9 read13 blank0a"`, you should return `[96, 18, 26, 0]`.
